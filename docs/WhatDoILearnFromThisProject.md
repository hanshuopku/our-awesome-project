## topic selection

- make sure to check the information given by AI. wrong direction means total waste of time.
- if you feel conterintuitive or uncomfortable with some explanations, think harder, read more, learn about how the theory had developed. this is where innovation starts
- do not be satisfied with explanation given by existing theory. actively criticize and give counterexamples.
- but make sure you fully understands the theory before diving into critics
- be willing to accept critics yet be willing to take a move
- hard work can't replace thinking
